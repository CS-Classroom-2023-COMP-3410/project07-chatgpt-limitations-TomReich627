After experimenting with the original game, I realized the primary problem is that the fruit border seemed to get further and further from the edges as the screen got more narrow. Additionally the game itself wasn't always mainting distance from the walls and ended up going off screen. The first thing I did was lock the fruit border to the edges so that it didn't push away from the wall as the screen got smaller, this fixed most of the issue. I then had to allow the game to maintain an appropriate shape relative to the screen size, this was mostly a matter of setting max and min width/height along with padding to maintain distance from the border.
