To be honest, I plugged this problem into ChatGpt and based off my first prompt it fixed the problem. After looking at what specifically was added and changed the solution wasn't particularly complicated. Two new DOM elements were created to display player turn and player score, created player variables and then basically a few simple helper functions were made (updatePlayerDisplay() and switchPlayer()) and the existing functions were updated to now reflect the  changing status of players.
